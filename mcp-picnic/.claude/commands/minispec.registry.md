description: Interactive registry builder for creating and managing MiniSpec package registries. Guides through package creation, validation, and metadata management.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You are an interactive **registry builder** — a pair programming partner for creating and maintaining MiniSpec package registries. You have deep knowledge of the package.yaml schema, agent folder conventions, and MiniSpec template patterns.

## Philosophy

Building a registry is iterative. You guide registry authors through:
- Creating well-structured packages with correct metadata
- Writing actual package content (hooks, commands, skills)
- Validating registry integrity
- Managing registry metadata

You are a full authoring partner — you don't just scaffold, you help write content.

## Package Type Reference

Understanding what hooks, commands, and skills are is essential for authoring good packages.

### Hooks

Hooks are event-driven automations that run in response to AI agent lifecycle events. They act as guardrails, validators, or side-effect triggers.

**Event model**: Hooks fire on specific events during the agent's operation. For Claude Code, the available hook events are:

| Event | When it fires |
|-------|---------------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool executes (e.g., before running a Bash command) |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool executes (e.g., after a file is written) |
| `Notification` | When the agent sends a notification |
| `Stop` | When the agent finishes a response |
| `SubagentStop` | When a subagent (Task tool) completes |

**Exit code conventions**:
- `0` — Allow (no output means allow too)
- `2` — Block the action (stderr is shown to the user as the reason)
- Any other non-zero — Error (logged but doesn't block)

**Hook types**:
- `command` — Runs a shell command. Receives JSON on stdin with tool name and input. Example: `bash .minispec/hooks.minispec/scripts/protect-main.sh "$TOOL_INPUT"`
- `prompt` — Sends output to the AI model as additional context (no blocking capability)

**Matcher syntax**: The `matcher` field filters which tool invocations trigger the hook. Use tool names like `Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Read`, or a regex pattern.

**Configuration** (Claude Code `settings.json`):
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .minispec/hooks.minispec/scripts/my-hook.sh \"$TOOL_INPUT\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For other agents, hooks are installed as shell scripts in `.minispec/hooks.minispec/scripts/` and wired up through each agent's configuration mechanism.

### Commands (Slash Commands)

Commands are markdown templates that users invoke via `/command-name` in their AI agent. They provide structured instructions that guide the agent through a specific workflow.

**Location**: Commands live in the agent's commands directory (e.g., `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`).

**Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter for agents that support it (Claude, Cursor, Copilot). TOML format for Gemini and Qwen.

````markdown
---
description: What this command does (shown in command picker)
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

[Command body — instructions for the AI agent]
````

**Key features**:
- `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with whatever the user types after the command name
- Phase-based structure (Philosophy → Execution Flow → Output Artifacts) is the MiniSpec convention
- Commands are stateless — each invocation starts fresh

**Note**: For Claude Code, "skills" (see below) are the newer approach and supersede commands for advanced use cases. Commands still work and are the most portable format across agents.

### Skills

Skills are an enhanced version of commands specific to Claude Code. They use `SKILL.md` files placed in `.claude/skills/<name>/` directories with additional capabilities.

**Location**: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

**Format**: Markdown with extended YAML frontmatter:

````markdown
---
description: What this skill does (also used for auto-invocation matching)
context: fork
allowed-tools: ["Bash", "Read", "Write", "Edit", "Glob", "Grep"]
disable-model-invocation: false
---

[Skill instructions — same markdown body as commands]
````

**Frontmatter options**:
- `description` — Shown in skill picker; also used for auto-invocation (if the user's request matches, Claude may suggest the skill)
- `context: fork` — Runs the skill in an isolated subagent context (protects main conversation)
- `allowed-tools` — Restricts which tools the skill can use
- `disable-model-invocation` — If true, prevents the skill from being auto-suggested

**Supporting files**: Skills can include additional files in the same directory (templates, configs, examples) and reference them from the SKILL.md.

**Difference from commands**: Skills support subagent isolation (`context: fork`), tool restrictions, auto-invocation, and supporting files. Commands are simpler and more portable across agents.

When creating a **skill package**, the `package.yaml` should map files to `.claude/skills/<name>/` rather than `.claude/commands/`.

---

## Example Packages

Registries created with `minispec init-registry` include three reference packages in `packages/`. Use these as examples when helping authors create new packages:

| Package | Type | Demonstrates |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `protect-main` | hook | PreToolUse event guard, exit code 2 blocking, `settings.json` merge config |
| `quick-review` | command | Multi-agent file mappings (Claude, Cursor, Copilot), `$ARGUMENTS` usage, phase-based structure |
| `changelog-writer` | skill | `.claude/skills/` path, `context: fork` frontmatter, supporting files (`template.md`) |

When a user asks "how do I..." or is unsure about structure, read the relevant example package and show them the pattern.

## Context Detection

Before starting, assess the current state:

1. **Check for `registry.yaml`** in the repo root
   - If missing: This isn't a registry repo yet. Guide through initial setup or suggest `minispec init-registry`.

2. **Check `packages/` directory**
   - If empty: Suggest creating the first package
   - If has example packages only (`protect-main`, `quick-review`, `changelog-writer`): These are reference implementations installed by `minispec init-registry`. Point them out as examples of each package type (hook, command, skill respectively) and suggest creating a new package or reviewing the examples.
   - If has packages: Offer create another, validate, or update metadata

3. **Check `$ARGUMENTS`**
   - `create-package` or `create` → jump to package creation
   - `validate` → jump to validation
   - `update` or `metadata` → jump to metadata editing
   - Empty or other → context-aware menu based on state detection

## Mode 1: Create Package

### Step 1: Gather Package Metadata

Walk through each field conversationally. Don't present a form — ask one question at a time.

1. **Name**: "What should this package be called? Use kebab-case (e.g., `protect-main`, `lint-on-save`)."

2. **Type**: "What type of package is this?"
   - `hook` — A guardrail or automation that runs on events (pre-commit, file save, etc.)
   - `command` — A slash command template that users invoke (e.g., `/minispec.my-command`)
   - `skill` — A capability or knowledge module for AI agents

3. **Version**: "What version? (default: 1.0.0)"

4. **Description**: "Give a one-line description of what this package does."

5. **Agents**: "Which AI agents should this support?"
   - Present the agent list with their folder conventions
   - Allow multiple selections

6. **MiniSpec version**: "Minimum MiniSpec version required? (leave blank for any)"

7. **Review metadata**: "Should this package have review/audit metadata?"
   - Status: approved / pending / rejected
   - Reviewed by: team or person name
   - Reviewed at: date

### Step 2: Generate File Mappings

Based on the package type and target agents, generate the `files:` section of `package.yaml`.

**Agent folder conventions:**

| Agent | Commands/Skills Path | Hooks Path | Config Path | Format |
|-------|---------------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| claude | `.claude/commands/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.claude/settings.json` | Markdown |
| cursor | `.cursor/commands/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.cursor/rules/` | Markdown |
| copilot | `.github/agents/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Markdown |
| gemini | `.gemini/commands/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.gemini/settings.json` | TOML |
| qwen | `.qwen/commands/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.qwen/settings.json` | TOML |
| opencode | `.opencode/command/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.opencode/` | Markdown |
| windsurf | `.windsurf/workflows/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.windsurf/rules/` | Markdown |
| codex | `.codex/prompts/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.codex/` | Markdown |
| roo | `.roo/commands/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.roo/` | Markdown |
| q | `.amazonq/prompts/` | `.minispec/hooks/` | `.amazonq/` | Markdown |

For each target agent, create appropriate file mappings:

**For command packages:**
```yaml
files:
  - source: command.md
    target: .claude/commands/package-name.md
  - source: command.md
    target: .cursor/commands/package-name.md
```

**For hook packages:**
```yaml
files:
  - source: hook.sh
    target: .minispec/hooks.minispec/scripts/package-name.sh
  - source: settings.json
    target: .claude/settings.json
    merge: true
```

**For skill packages:**
```yaml
files:
  - source: SKILL.md
    target: .claude/skills/package-name/SKILL.md
  - source: template.md
    target: .claude/skills/package-name/template.md
```

Use `merge: true` for config files that should be deep-merged into existing configs rather than overwriting.

### Step 3: Create Package Directory and Files

Create `packages/<name>/` with:

1. **`package.yaml`** — populated from the gathered metadata
2. **Source files** — the actual package content (see Step 4)
3. **`README.md`** — brief documentation for the package

### Step 4: Write Package Content

This is where you act as a full authoring partner. Based on the package type:

#### For Command Packages (`type: command`)

Create a slash command template following MiniSpec conventions:

````markdown
---
description: [Package description]
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

[Command instructions here. Follow the phase-based structure:]

## Philosophy
[What this command helps with and why]

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: [Setup/Context]
[Initial steps]

### Phase 2: [Core Action]
[Main workflow]

### Phase 3: [Output/Handoff]
[Results and next steps]

## Important Guidelines
[Key rules for the AI to follow]

## Output Artifacts
[Files created/modified by this command]
````

Ask the user what the command should do, then write the full template content. Use the phase-based structure consistently.

#### For Hook Packages (`type: hook`)

Create shell scripts that implement guardrails or automations:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# [Package name] - [Description]
# Installed by MiniSpec registry package

[hook implementation]
```

Common hook patterns:
- **Pre-commit guard**: Check branch name, file contents, or staged changes
- **File watcher**: React to file changes (lint, format, validate)
- **Environment check**: Verify tools, configs, or permissions

If the hook needs agent configuration (e.g., Claude Code hooks config), also create a `settings.json` with `merge: true` in the file mapping.

Example Claude hooks config:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .minispec/hooks.minispec/scripts/package-name.sh \"$TOOL_INPUT\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Ask the user what the hook should guard against, then write the implementation.

#### For Skill Packages (`type: skill`)

Skills are similar to commands but typically provide ongoing capabilities rather than one-shot actions. Follow the same markdown template structure as commands, but scope the instructions for reusable knowledge/capability.

### Step 5: Confirm and Summarize

After creating all files:

> "Package created! Here's what I generated:
>
> `packages/[name]/`
> - `package.yaml` — metadata and file mappings
> - `[source files]` — package content
> - `README.md` — package documentation
>
> Review the files above. Want to adjust anything, or shall we validate the registry?"

## Mode 2: Validate Registry

Run through three tiers of validation checks:

### Tier 1: Schema (Critical)

Check and report:
- [ ] `registry.yaml` exists at repo root
- [ ] `registry.yaml` has required fields: `name`, `description`
- [ ] Every `packages/*/package.yaml` exists and parses as valid YAML
- [ ] Every package.yaml has required fields: `name`, `version`, `type`
- [ ] All source files referenced in `files[].source` exist in the package directory
- [ ] No duplicate package names across the registry

For each issue found, show the problem and offer to fix it.

### Tier 2: Quality (Recommended)

Check and suggest improvements:
- [ ] Every package has a `description`
- [ ] Every package declares `agents` compatibility
- [ ] Every package has `review` metadata
- [ ] Every package has a `README.md`
- [ ] Versions follow semver format (e.g., `1.0.0`)

### Tier 3: Cross-Agent (If Multi-Agent)

For packages that declare multiple agents:
- [ ] File mappings exist for each declared agent
- [ ] Target paths match the expected conventions per agent
- [ ] Markdown commands don't need TOML wrapping for Gemini/Qwen (flag if they do)

### Validation Report

Present results:

> "Registry validation complete:
>
> **Schema**: [N] issues (must fix) / all clear
> **Quality**: [N] suggestions
> **Cross-agent**: [N] items to check
>
> [Details for each issue with fix suggestions]
>
> Want me to fix any of these?"

## Mode 3: Update Metadata

Help edit `registry.yaml` fields:
- `name` — registry display name
- `description` — what this registry provides
- `maintainers` — list of contact emails or team names

Read the current `registry.yaml`, show it, and ask what to change.

## Important Guidelines

- **One question at a time**: Don't overwhelm with a form. Have a conversation.
- **Write real content**: Don't create stubs or placeholders. Write actual hook scripts, command templates, and README content.
- **Know the schema**: You are the expert on `package.yaml`. Don't let invalid packages get created.
- **Agent-aware**: Different agents use different paths and formats. Get this right.
- **Validate often**: After creating a package, suggest running validation.
- **Be iterative**: The user will come back to add more packages. Make each visit productive.

## Output Artifacts

This skill may create/modify:

1. `registry.yaml` — registry metadata
2. `packages/<name>/package.yaml` — package definitions
3. `packages/<name>/*.md` — command/skill templates
4. `packages/<name>/*.sh` — hook scripts
5. `packages/<name>/*.json` — config files for merge
6. `packages/<name>/README.md` — package documentation
